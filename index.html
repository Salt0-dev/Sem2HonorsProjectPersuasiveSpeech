  <h1>The Impact of Social Media Among Teens and Children</h1>
  <p>Social media has become a significant part of children’s lives in today's world. It allows them to easily access media and be able to interact socially with people all over the world anytime they want. Social media also allows children to post or create whatever they want, which can help develop creativity. Most parents think that social media cannot be harmful to children. However, too much social media could become a problem.</p>
  <p>While social media does allow children to express their creativity and develop useful traits, it can become harmful when used too much and lead to bad habits. Research shows that social media can cause kids to become socially isolated, become unhealthy, and can even damage their mental well-being. It may be helpful for some parents to limit the time spent on social media for their own kid's health.</p>
  <p> While social media does allow children to express their creativity and develop useful traits, it can become harmful when used too much and lead to bad habits. Research shows that social media can cause kids to become socially isolated, become unhealthy, and can even damage their mental well-being. It may be helpful for some parents to limit the time spent on social media for their own kid's health.</p>
  <p>The article “Teens and social media use: What's the impact?” from The Mayo Clinic states, “A 2019 study with a sample of over 6,500 Americans aged 12 to 15 years, which utilized social media for more than three hours per day were found to have a greater chance of experiencing mental health issues.”. The article shows that while social media can have many benefits, such as providing a platform to connect and socialize with friends and family, it can also have harmful effects on their mental well-being if used excessively.</p>
  <p>Young children and teenagers' physical health may also be impacted by excessive use of social media. According to the article “The Use of Social Media in Children and Adolescents: Scoping Review on the Potential Risks.” by Elena Bozzola et al. “Children and teenagers that use social media consistently before bedtime have 53% higher odds of experiencing poor sleep quality”. The article also states, “Teenagers who use computers and smartphones may experience daytime sleepiness and fatigue, shorter sleep duration, later bedtime, and unfavorable sleep habits over time”. When Social media is used before bedtime, it causes teenagers to stay up later at night, ultimately leading to poor sleep quality and bad habits.</p>
  <p>Social media can be used to communicate between friends and family anywhere, which can help when long-distance communication is needed. However, it may also create a habit for the user to rely on social media too much. The blog “Understanding the Effects of Social Isolation on Mental Health.”  by Tulane University states, “Communication via social media can be beneficial to stay connected to others, but it can lead to isolation if it becomes a substitute for in-person conversations and socialization.”. This statement shows that more teens are using social media to communicate rather than getting out into the real world and socially interacting with each other, causing the social skills needed in life not to be developed.</p>
  <p>In conclusion, social media can be a great way to spend free time, but it should be used in moderation to avoid picking up bad habits such as staying up too late at night to scroll through social media. These habits can cause teenagers to become socially isolated or damage their mental well-being. If children and teenagers start to use social media excessively, parents should regulate or limit the time spent on social media to avoid these issues.</p>
